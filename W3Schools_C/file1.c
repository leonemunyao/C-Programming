// C is a general-purpose language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories iN 1972
// It was developed to write the UNIX operating system. If you understand C, there will be no difficulty in understanding the popular programming languages like Python C++ Javascript etc 
// as the syntax is similar. The include is header file library. The \n is called the escape sequence and it does insert a new line at the end of the printf. It forces the cursor 
// to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen. 
//
// Other escape sequences are \t, \\ which inserts a backslash and \" which inserts a double quote. 
//
// Comments in C, we use // for a single line and use /* */ for multi-line comments
