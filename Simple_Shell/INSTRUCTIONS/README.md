Understanding the intructions required for the Simple Shell Project

Important Message

The simple shell tests everything that I have learned so far. This includes the Basics of Programming, Basics of C, Basics of thinking like an Engineer, Group work and Learning how to learn. First remember the Framework. 

Never copy and paste any code. Always write code alone from scratch after you get help to check that you have actually understood. If you cannot do it, you haven't understood enough and need to study more. Do not rewrite code from memory, but from understanding. At ALX SE you never learn the solution, you learn how walk towards the solution. You learn to create the tutorials, so if you follow one, you are looking at the solution, you are taking a very serious shortcut that will undermine your learning. Last thing about the framework note that the first thing you need to do is to read. Every detail counts. Make sure you read and test everything.
